Speak to me enough times, and at some point, you’ll hear me say, “Hold on, let me collect my thoughts” This is a small portion of a bigger goal I think I strive for.

Coherence- *the state of being connected. Logical, orderly, and consistent relation of parts*. This is as important in speech and more so for me in thought; it’s easy to convey an idea and have the person you are talking to have a rough idea of what you mean. Bringing your thoughts together so that they are consistent is a problem that I have a hard time describing. How do I describe what I’m thinking if I’m not sure of it myself? 


The answer to this is work in progress; this blog serves as a first step towards describing my thoughts more accurately, and describing the problem is a good first step to understanding and ultimately fixing it; it funny to think I  pictured this post being a lot longer, but maybe less is more?

In any case, my quest has continued, but I think it’s one I’ll enjoy; in the end, I think we should all strive to convey this in a consistent manner, and I look up to those who already can.
