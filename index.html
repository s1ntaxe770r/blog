Particularly in the context of distributed systems.
The rationale behind my thinking is fairly simple. In a large distributed system, how does the system maintain order ? Better still how does each process know which event came first?
Before the rambling continues, perhaps i should start by defining what an event is. An event simply refers an occurrence or action within a process. This could include sending or receiving a message or some kind of local action such as writing to disk.

Coherence- the state of being connected. Logical, orderly, and consistent relation of parts. This is as important in speech and more so for me in thought; it’s easy to convey an idea and have the person you are talking to have a rough idea of what you mean. Bringing your thoughts together so that they are consistent is a problem that I have a hard time describing. How do I describe what I’m thinking if I’m not sure of it myself?

I’m using the Raspberry Pi 4 with a 128GB SD card running Raspbian. Would this be enough? No idea but I’m about to find out.
Current Setup So far the only configuration I have made is assigning a static IP address and connected the PI to my router over Ethernet.

Lately I have found myself pondering how distributed systems handle transactions, particularly what happens if one database replica is out of sync, how should the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; distributed system handle such?
Turns out there are few ways of handling distributed transactions, and two phase commit or 2PC is one of them. So I am doing the logical thing and writing down what I have managed to learn at 2:32am on a weekday.

In this talk Daniel goes over how the web has evolved from HTTP/1.1 down to HTTP2 and now HTTP 3 which is apparently going to save us all(no offense,i think QUIC) is an amazing protocol, but that&rsquo;s besides the point here.

FULL DISCLAIMER: while I am being paid to write this post the opinions and views expressed here are completely mines.
So what&rsquo;s this thing anyway? That was my first question as I have only ever heard about Kubestack in passing.
Kubestack is a GitOps framework aimed at simplifying the process of spinning up a Kubernetes cluster and automating subsequent deployments to your cluster. At the time of writing, Kubestack supports GKE, AKS, and EKS. Alright, now I know what it is but how is this any different than building my own CI/CD pipeline? Only one way to find out&mldr;

I attempt to answer the question that&rsquo;s been on my mind for days now. &ldquo;What the heck is a data plane?&rdquo;.
To fully understand we need to back track a bit. A data plane is one of two major components of a service mesh , yet that alone is far from the answer i seek.
Taking a closer look To find the answers i seek, it&rsquo;s worth taking look at the architecture of a typical service mesh and analyze from there.
